        "initial_assessment-radiation oncologist": "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The CT scan is of the head and neck region, with two bounding boxes provided:\n   - Box 1: [253, 233, 22, 253, 290, 127]\n   - Box 2: [262, 178, 95, 262, 214, 119]\n\n2. These coordinates are normalized and define volumetric regions within the scan. The first box appears to cover a region in the lower neck or upper thoracic inlet area, possibly including lymph node regions or soft tissue structures. The second box is more superior and anterior, likely involving structures in the oropharynx or base of tongue region.\n\n3. From a radiation oncology perspective, these ROIs could represent:\n   - Box 1: Possibly a nodal disease region or involved lymph node in the lower neck.\n   - Box 2: Possibly the primary tumor site or involved lymph nodes in the oropharynx.\n\n4. Visible anatomical structures in these regions typically include:\n   - Pharyngeal mucosa, base of tongue, tonsillar region.\n   - Cervical lymph nodes, carotid artery, jugular vein.\n   - Muscles of the neck and airway structures.\n\n5. Patterns or abnormalities to note:\n   - If the ROIs correspond to disease, they may represent squamous cell carcinoma involvement.\n   - The presence of multiple ROIs suggests both primary tumor and nodal disease.\n   - No direct visualization of bone erosion or gross airway obstruction is mentioned, but these should be assessed.\n\n6. From a radiation oncology standpoint, the involvement of both primary and nodal sites is critical for treatment planning, dose prescription, and prognosis.\n\nFinal answer:\nAnswer: Alive",
