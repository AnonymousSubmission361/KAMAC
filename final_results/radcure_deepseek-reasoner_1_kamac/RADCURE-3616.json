        "initial_assessment-radiation oncologist": "Step-by-step analysis as a radiation oncologist:\n\n1. The provided CT scan includes two bounding boxes with normalized coordinates:\n   - Box 1: [256, 226, 125, 256, 260, 154]\n   - Box 2: [253, 189, 76, 253, 234, 102]\n\n2. These coordinates correspond to specific volumetric regions within the head and neck CT scan. Given the z, y, x axes and the values, these likely represent regions in the oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal area, possibly including lymph nodes or tumor volumes.\n\n3. From a radiation oncology perspective, the identification of these ROIs is critical for delineating gross tumor volume (GTV) or involved lymph nodes for treatment planning.\n\n4. Without direct visualization of the scan, but based on the coordinates and typical anatomical landmarks:\n   - The first bounding box (higher z and y values) may correspond to a region near the base of tongue or oropharynx.\n   - The second bounding box (lower z and y values) may correspond to a lower neck region, possibly involved lymph nodes.\n\n5. No explicit abnormalities or tumor characteristics are described, but the presence of masked ROIs suggests these are areas of interest for radiation targeting.\n\n6. From a survival probability standpoint, involvement of multiple regions or lymph nodes generally indicates a more advanced stage, which can impact prognosis negatively.\n\n7. The exact survival prediction would depend on additional clinical data (tumor size, HPV status, nodal involvement, treatment modality), which is not provided here.\n\nFinal answer based on the given data and typical radiation oncology interpretation:\n\nAnswer: Alive",
