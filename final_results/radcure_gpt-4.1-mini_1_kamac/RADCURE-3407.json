[240, 219, 119, 240, 245, 139]\n2. [232, 191, 127, 232, 237, 136]\n\n- These coordinates correspond to volumetric regions within the scan, normalized to image size.\n- The first bounding box likely covers a region in the posterior nasal cavity or nasopharynx, overlapping with the masked ROI.\n- The second bounding box is slightly inferior and anterior, possibly encompassing adjacent soft tissue or lymph node regions.\n- Both bounding boxes are relatively small, indicating focused areas of interest, likely tumor and possibly involved lymph nodes or adjacent structures.\n\n**Step 3: Clinical Reasoning**\n\n- Patient is a 75.4-year-old female with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the paranasal sinus, specifically maxillary sinus.\n- Tumor staging is T4b, indicating very advanced local disease with possible invasion into critical adjacent structures.\n- No regional lymph node involvement (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0).\n- ECOG performance status is 0, indicating good functional status.\n- Treatment planned is radiation therapy alone, 60 Gy in 25 fractions, without chemotherapy.\n- The masked ROI and bounding boxes likely represent the primary tumor and possibly involved adjacent tissues.\n- Given the advanced T4b stage, the tumor may involve critical structures such as the orbit, skull base, or infratemporal fossa.\n- Radiation therapy alone at 60 Gy is a standard approach for unresectable or high-risk adenoid cystic carcinoma.\n- The absence of nodal or distant disease is favorable for local control.\n- However, adenoid cystic carcinoma is known for perineural invasion and late distant metastases, which may impact long-term survival.\n- The patient's age and good performance status support tolerance of radiation therapy.\n- The imaging does not show gross bone destruction or extensive soft tissue invasion on this slice, but the T4b stage suggests more extensive disease elsewhere.\n\n**Step 4: Integrated Conclusion**\n\n- The CT scan shows a localized but advanced tumor in the paranasal sinus region, consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.\n- The masked ROI and bounding boxes correspond to the primary tumor and possibly involved adjacent soft tissues.\n- Clinical staging (T4bN0M0) and pathology indicate a high-risk tumor with potential for local invasion but no nodal or distant spread.\n- Radiation therapy alone at 60 Gy is appropriate given the patient's status and tumor characteristics.\n- Prognosis is guarded due to advanced local disease and tumor biology, but absence of nodal/distant disease and good performance status are positive factors.\n- Close follow-up is essential for early detection of recurrence or metastasis.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: Alive**",

Input from a surgical oncologist is important to evaluate potential surgical interventions or confirm unresectability. A medical oncologist's perspective is valuable to discuss systemic treatment options, especially given the tumor's aggressive nature and potential for perineural invasion and distant metastasis.
