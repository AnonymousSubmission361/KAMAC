        "Round 2-Turn 1-Round 2-Turn 1-gap_recruited_discuss-participate-diagnostic radiologist (head and neck radiologist)": "No. \n\nBased on the combined earlier and latest opinions from the radiation oncologist, diagnostic radiologist, and medical oncologist, the imaging findings and clinical context are well understood. The differences in prognosis assessment (alive vs. dead) stem from clinical interpretation rather than imaging uncertainty. There is no indication that additional expert input (e.g., surgical oncologist, pathologist) is needed at this stage for further image interpretation or treatment planning. The current multidisciplinary opinions sufficiently cover the radiologic and clinical aspects relevant to this case.",

The only notable discrepancy is in the final survival assessment (\"Alive\" vs. \"Dead\"), which likely reflects differences in interpretation of the impact of treatment choice (radiation alone without chemotherapy) on survival.\n\nGiven that the imaging and clinical data are concordant and the treatment plan is clear, there is no immediate need to consult additional experts at this time. Further multidisciplinary discussion could focus on optimizing systemic therapy, but no new expert consultation is required based on the current information.",
