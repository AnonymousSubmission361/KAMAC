However, there is conflicting clinical information regarding distant metastasis. From a radiation oncology perspective, the presence of distant metastasis (M1) would significantly alter the treatment approach, shifting the focus from curative local therapy to systemic management and possible palliative radiation.\n\nGiven this, I strongly recommend a thorough systemic evaluation to confirm metastatic status. If distant metastases are confirmed, systemic therapy should be prioritized, and radiation fields may need adjustment to balance symptom control and toxicity. Your expertise in systemic therapy decisions is critical to guide optimal integration with radiation and improve overall patient outcomes.",
        "Round 2-Turn 1-gap_recruited_assessment-medical oncologist": "Answer: Dead\n\nRationale: Although the initial staging was III (T3N1M0), the updated information indicates the presence of distant metastasis (Distant: Yes). This changes the prognosis significantly, as distant metastatic disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is associated with a poor outcome despite chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, the patient is more likely to have a fatal outcome given the metastatic spread.",
