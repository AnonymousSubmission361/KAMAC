My role is to provide precise imaging analysis to support clinical decision-making.\n\nBased on the CT scan and clinical data, I observe a localized supraglottic laryngeal tumor (T1) with no evident local or regional spread on imaging. However, clinical information indicates distant metastasis (M1), which significantly worsens prognosis despite the early stage and good performance status. This discrepancy between imaging and clinical staging suggests occult metastatic disease not visible on this scan.\n\nGiven this, I emphasize that while the imaging supports a localized primary tumor suitable for radiation therapy, the presence of distant metastasis must be factored into prognosis and treatment planning. Therefore, the patient’s survival probability is reduced due to metastatic disease, even with optimal local treatment.\n\nI share this to ensure that radiation therapy planning considers the overall clinical context, including metastatic status, to optimize patient management.",
