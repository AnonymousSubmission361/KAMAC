This fundamental difference in tumor site, staging, and clinical outcome implications warrants further discussion with the head and neck surgeon and medical oncologist to clarify clinical findings, pathology, and treatment response.

The masked ROI and bounding boxes correspond to a buccal mucosa tumor with no evidence of nodal involvement or distant metastasis. The patient has a T2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma, HPV-negative, with persistent disease after radiation therapy alone. This clinical scenario typically carries a less favorable prognosis compared to HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. \n\nGiven these imaging findings and clinical context, I believe the primary site is oral cavity, not oropharynx, and the prognosis is guarded due to persistent local disease.
