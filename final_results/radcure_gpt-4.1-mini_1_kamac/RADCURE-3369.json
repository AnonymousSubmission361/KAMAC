While radiation alone at 70 Gy is standard for local control, the presence of multiple involved lymph nodes (N2) significantly increases the risk of systemic relapse. If the patient’s comorbidities and preferences allow, adding concurrent chemotherapy or considering immunotherapy could improve outcomes by addressing micrometastatic disease. Close follow-up is essential, but systemic therapy should be strongly considered to optimize survival chances.",
