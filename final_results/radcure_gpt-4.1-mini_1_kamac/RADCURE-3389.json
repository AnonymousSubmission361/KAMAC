A medical oncologist can provide expertise on systemic therapy options, including the potential role of chemotherapy or immunotherapy, which may improve outcomes beyond radiation alone. A head and neck surgeon can assess surgical options or biopsy confirmation and help evaluate resectability or salvage strategies. These perspectives are critical to complement radiation therapy planning and dosing.",
