This could clarify the presence or absence of distant metastases beyond the imaged field and help reconcile imaging findings with clinical staging and prognosis.",

The imaging does not demonstrate visible distant metastases within the scanned field, although clinical data suggests possible distant spread.

        "Round 2-Turn 1-gap_recruited_assessment-medical oncologist": "Answer: Dead\n\nRationale: Although the initial staging was T3N2M0 (stage III), the updated information indicates the presence of distant metastasis (Distant: Yes). This changes the prognosis significantly, as metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma generally has a poor outcome despite chemoradiotherapy. Given the systemic spread, the likelihood of long-term survival is low.",
